## Overview

[786](https://vargiskhan.com/log/the-number-786-its-origin-meaning-and-significance/) is the numerical expression for “Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim” meaning "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful". [786.world](https://786.world/) is a Discord based muslim community which provides a place for people to 
meet other like minded people and discuss their faith or exist in a place with the knowledge that everyone shares the same beliefs and values.

## Rationale

I grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland. The only muslim people I knew were my family and close relatives. When I left that all behind and moved to London, England, I felt a disconnect between who I was and the people around me. I didn't feel free to express my faith or beliefs. Many years on I've still struggled to find that community, the ummah. My hope is this place can help us all connect regardless of where we reside.
